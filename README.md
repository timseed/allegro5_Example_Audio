So before having to deal with the general project complexities, I thought it was prudent to try and just load and play these sounds without any other distractions or things that could go wrong.

## Pre-requisites

# Code Structure

I have tried as much as possible to keep the code as close to each other as possible. There are slight differences in the Mutex invocation between C and CPP (nothing I can do about that), but both code-bases, do the same operations. Namely

  - join Thread
  - exit
